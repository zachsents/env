# WIP

When I left off, I just finished up a basic parser to handle variable computation. There are a few bugs with some of the operators, but in general it works.

Some of the nomenclature is a little weird, too, e.g. environment, profile, etc.

This is probably overkill but actually seems pretty useful if the kinks are worked out. It's also probably more worth it to use an existing parser library like nearlyjs to define the parser. That way all edge-cases are covered. I don't know what I'm doing.

Writing this parser has taken **days** so I need to stop, but maybe I'll pick it up another day. It really shouldn't be that challenging, but it is.
